Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Scale

The Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Scale Calculator is designed to help health professionals estimate the risk of serious adverse events in patients presenting with acute heart failure in an emergency department. The calculator utilizes the Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Scale (OHFRS), a validated clinical tool that considers a set of 10 critical factors including patients' medical history, vital signs, and lab results.

These factors include history of stroke or TIA, history of intubation for respiratory distress, heart rate > 110 bpm at disposition, systolic blood pressure < 115 mmHg at disposition, SaO2 < 90% on room air at any point during visit, creatinine > 90 Î¼mol/L (1.02 mg/dL) at disposition, age > 65, current use of home oxygen therapy, arrival by ambulance, and absence of ACE inhibitor or ARB at presentation.

The user interface allows for quick and easy input of these factors in a binary format (Yes/No), and upon the click of a button, it calculates and displays the patient's OHFRS score, which correlates to their risk of experiencing a serious adverse event. This tool is intended to support clinical decision making and does not replace professional medical advice. The results obtained from the calculator should always be used in conjunction with an overall assessment of the patient.
